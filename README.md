The system consists of three main panels: the Student Panel, the Admin Panel, and the Custom Panel.
- **In the Student Panel**, students have the ability to raise concerns by creating and ranking complaints based on urgency. If these issues remain unresolved within 2 days , they are automatically forwarded to higher authorities for attention. Moreover, students can submit applications that are directed to the relevant handler for efficient communication. Furthermore, students can evaluate the performance of individuals handling tasks and take advantage of real-time facilities like managing laundry queues and reserving seats on college buses.
- **The Admin Panel** empowers administrators to efficiently handle incoming applications and complaints, assign tasks with deadlines, and communicate effectively within the administrative team. Admins also have the authority to book college buses as needed, ensuring smooth communication and task management.
- **The Custom Panel** offers specialized functionalities tailored to specific roles within the campus community. Guards can manage the laundry system. Rating provided students  can be viewed by some admin.SuperAdmins have the capability to delete ratings for quality control purposes, and drivers can efficiently manage passenger lists for bus trips.
